```json
"google-docs-mcp": {
  "command": "/usr/local/bin",  // or wherever your Python binaries live
  "args": [
    "run",
    "--with",
    "mcp[cli]",
    "--with",
    "google-api-python-client",
    "--with",
    "google-auth",
    "--with",
    "google-auth-oauthlib",
    "--with",
    "google-auth-httplib2",
    "--with",
    "python-dotenv",
    "mcp",
    "run",
    "/Users/sujannandikolsunilkumar/docs mcp/docs-mcp/server.py" #Your path will be different, don't need to change it.
